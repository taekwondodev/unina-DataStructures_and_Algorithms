# Data Structures and Algorithms
I re-implemented the library of this Data Structures on C++ for the 'Laboratorio Di Algoritmi e Strutture Dati' Exam.
To compile you need to use Linux or WSL because of how the zlasdtest are written, zlasdtests are written by the Teacher, zmytest are written by me. 
The hierarchy of the data structures starts from abstract classes and then I override the methods into the data structures.
The classes are templates for every use. They are the most possible generycs.
The comments are in italian.

## Unit Test
To start the test before calling the command make in the linux terminal on vscode, Move into the directory.
```bash
cd exercise
```
Now launch the command to start compiling
```bash
make
```
After compiling open the main file with the command
```bash
./main
```

## List

## Stack
Stack has two version. One List version and one Vector version.

## Queue
Queue has two version. One List version and one Vector version.

## BinaryTree
Bynary tree has two version. One List version and one Vector version.

## Iterator
I re-implemented also the Iterator for the Binary Trees, for every order. I implemented one general abstract class and then the implementation on the BinaryTree.cpp file

## Bynary Search Tree
I used the BinaryTreeLnk version for implementing the BST.

## HashTable
HashTable has two version. One is the Closing Address and the other one is the Open Addressing.
