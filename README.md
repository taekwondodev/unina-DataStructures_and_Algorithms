# Data Structures and Algorithms
I re-implemented the library of this Data Structures on C++ for the 'Laboratorio Di Algoritmi e Strutture Dati' Exam.
To compile you need to use Linux or WSL because of how the Test are written.
The tests are written by the Teacher.
To start the test call the command make in the linux terminal on vscode.

```bash
make
```
It will compile and then open the main file with the command

```bash
./main
```

## Stack
Stack has two version. One List version and one Vector version.
