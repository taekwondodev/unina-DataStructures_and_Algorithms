# Data Structures and Algorithms
I re-implemented the library of this Data Structures on C++ for the 'Laboratorio Di Algoritmi e Strutture Dati' Exam.
To compile you need to use Linux or WSL because of how the zlasdtest are written, zlasdtests are written by the Teacher.
The comments are in italian.
To start the test call the command make in the linux terminal on vscode.

```bash
make
```
It will compile and then open the main file with the command

```bash
./main
```

## Stack
Stack has two version. One List version and one Vector version.
